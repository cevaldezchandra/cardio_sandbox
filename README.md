This repository contains serveral R and python scripts (scripts/) used to calculate polygenic risk scores (PRS) for certain cariovascular outcomes (i.e. myocardial infarction, stroke). The data used was sourced from the UK Biobank (https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/). Some scripts that contained proprietary data were removed from the folder.
